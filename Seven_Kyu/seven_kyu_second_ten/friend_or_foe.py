#31. Friend or Foe?, Wed, 10/04/23

# Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.

# If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...

# Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]

# i.e.

# friend ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Mark"] `shouldBe` ["Ryan", "Mark"]
# Note: keep the original order of the names in the output.

def friend(x):
    
    friends = []
    for friend in x:
        if len(friend) == 4:
            friends.append(friend)
    return friends
